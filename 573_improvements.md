Here are some meaningful improvements for the lecture notes:

1.  At the end of lecture notes 6, we mentioned that "either L1 or L2 regularized linear regression is affected by scaling". The notes just state this point of view without much explanation. I found this concept difficult to understand due to the lack of intuitive feel for the impact of scaling. I think it would be helpful to add practical examples to demonstrate this impact. The same concept also applies to polynomial transformations in lecture notes 3. Using concrete examples to demonstrate why scaling should be performed after polynomial transformations will give us a better understanding of this concept.

2.  In lecture notes 8, the explanation of various SHAP plots is not very clear. One reason for this is that for classification problems, each class has a SHAP value, but we only focus on one class (i.e., class 1) in our explanation. This easily makes us confused about whether the SHAP value of a certain feature will push the prediction to the positive or negative direction. Because we need to consider not only the positive and negative SHAP value, but also the class corresponding to the SHAP value. A better solution is to illustrate the difference between the SHAP values of the two categories through two SHAP plots (binary example). Second, the interpretation of the various SHAP plots is less clear. It would be best to add a very detailed explanation below each plot, because SHAP values are a very abstract concept.

3.  There are significant deviations between the lecture notes and the slides in the second half of the course. Some of the content mentioned in the slides do not appear in the lecture notes. This means that we need to study both lecture notes and slides, which is almost 1.5 to 2 times the expected study time. Considering the high intense of the MDS program, and the fact that we also need to take three other courses at the same time, I recommend modifying the lecture notes to cover everything in the slides (i.e., in mathematical notation, slides $\subseteq$ lecture notes). In this way, during review, we can master the entire course content using only lecture notes.
